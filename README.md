# localization_rnn
Cricket Action Localization using sequential deep neural networks and features extracted using pretrained models.

## Tasks

1. Extracting video features using pretrained C3D models.

2. Using RNN/LSTM networks on sequence of spatio-temporal features (C3D, BOW, HoG, HOF etc.) for action localization on Cricket Highlights dataset.
